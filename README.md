## About

<p>
A language made to be similar to the natural language Nepali, created especially for Nepalese students who find communicating ideas in English difficult.
This language is a project I started keeping in mind 2 facts:
  
- English-medium schools are still quite rare in many parts of Nepal
- A significant number of Nepalese students who find mathematics and natural sciences interesting give up on programming just because the syntax feels a little difficult as well as most programming tutorials are in English. 
  
 I do not intend this to be an industrial strength programming language.

I'm not sure how long it will take to get this project to a usable state.

An example of a simple while loop in "Nepali" can be found in the app/nepali file of this repository.

Any contributors are always welcome.
